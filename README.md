# Coupon System (Legacy Project)

This project was built in 2022 as an early-stage learning exercise in backend development using Spring Boot.

It implements a basic coupon management system with role-based access:
- Admins: manage companies and customers
- Companies: create and manage coupons
- Customers: purchase and view coupons

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- REST API (Controllers, Services, DTOs)
- Role-based authorization
- Maven

## Why Archive It?

This project represents an earlier stage in my backend development journey.  
Since then, I have shifted my focus toward understanding how backend systems work under the hood, by building projects from scratch without frameworks.
